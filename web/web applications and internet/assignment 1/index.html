                About Me
            </h3>
            <p>
            I am a student currently studying at Independent University, Bangladesh and have nearly finished my undergraduate. I am a bit shy around people whom I don't know about, but once I know them, then I can talk to them freely. I love my friends and family. I miss one of my friend who used to talk to me a lot during the first few semesters at IUB. We really used to talk a lot but one day I saw that he started to act a bit differently and he stopped talking to me. I don't know if it it's my fault, and even if it is, I hope he forgives me.

            <p>
            I really love to be adventerous and try new things, but due to pandemic and other reasons I end up staying at home. I also love listening to music and talking to my friends and family whenever I'm free. I used to watch TV with my sisters, but as my sisters got married, so I've also lost interest in watching TV to be honest even though I have a TV at home.

             I have a good command on written and oral communication in English. I am also very experienced on proof reading. I have a moderately good command on C, C++, Java and Python and I believe I would be able to solve problems within the best of my abilities. I can also try to troubleshoot software related issues and set up system software and applications.
