# Observer

Given below is the description of the implementation of the Observer design pattern in C++. Let's break down the key components and steps involved:

1. **Client Perspective:**
   - A new group is created: `Group group = new Group`.
   - Three users are created with user IDs 1, 2, and 3.
   - Users are added to the group using the `subscribe` function.
   - A message is sent to all users in the group using the `notify` function.

2. **Subscribe and Unsubscribe:**
   - The `subscribe` function adds a user to the list of subscribers (users) in the group.
   - The `unsubscribe` function removes a user from the list of subscribers.

3. **Notify Function:**
   - The `notify` function sends a message to all users in the group.
   - For each user in the list of subscribers, the `notify` function is called, passing the message to each user.

4. **ISubscriber Interface:**
   - An interface `ISubscriber` is defined with a pure virtual function `notify`.
   - The `User` class is created, inheriting from `ISubscriber`.
   - The `notify` function is implemented in the `User` class to output a message indicating that the user received a message.

5. **Group Class:**
   - A `Group` class is created with a list of `ISubscriber` objects (users).
   - The `subscribe` function adds a user to the list.
   - The `unsubscribe` function removes a user from the list.
   - The `notify` function sends a message to all users in the list.

6. **Output Example:**
   - The example output demonstrates the dynamic nature of the Observer pattern.
   - Initially, users 1, 2, and 3 are subscribed to the group and receive a message.
   - User 1 is unsubscribed, and a new message is sent, resulting in only users 2 and 3 receiving the message.

7. **Observer Design Pattern:**
   - The Observer pattern allows a subject (in this case, the `Group` class) to maintain a list of dependents (observers or subscribers) and notify them of any state changes.
   - Subscribers (users) implement a common interface (`ISubscriber`) with a `notify` function, allowing them to respond to changes.

8. **Flexibility:**
   - The Observer pattern provides flexibility, allowing dynamic addition or removal of subscribers without affecting the subject.

In summary, the Observer design pattern is implemented in the context of a group and users. The users subscribe to the group, and when the group sends a message, all subscribed users are notified. The pattern allows for a loosely coupled and flexible design.
